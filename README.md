This program recognizes both JPG,JPEG,PNG,MZE extensions the last is "proprietary" an example of witch is in the src folder
really its just textual representation of the various data that the game outputs in general it is only used for the save 
function of the game any JPEG,JPG,PNG once saved will be saved in this MZE format.

You may experience some hang when initializing and after selecting the wrong intial "default" file I have no idea why
this happens and I believe its just a problem that converting the Java project to a java exec created.  I will eventually 
try and solve it but for now a simple restart whould work just fine.

Note that YOU MUST load a DEFUALT file first.  This unfortunately was the specification for this project I may change
it in the future but since I included a default in the src folder I dont really know when I'll do that.  After having started 
using a default you can simply open any other PNG,JPG,JPEG save it as "defaultXYZ"then open that one next time or simply rename 
the file to "defaultXYZ" as long as the filename contains "defualt" you can have anything else after or before and it will still
be recognized as a "defualt file".

This program also allows you to load a background image just for fun. :)

Controls:

Left Click and Left Click to place a tile you can do this either way i.e. going to the board or going to the shelves.

  You cannot replace one tile with another again another specification might remove at later date.
  If the tile is highlighted blue then the next click will move it.  If it's read then that is an illegal move.
  Reset will reset all tiles to their postion when last loaded.
  
Right Click to rotate the tile
  Full 360 rotation
  
The game will automatically tell you if youe won i.e. the maze is correct

Cheers and Enjoy!
